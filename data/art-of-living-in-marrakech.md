# The Art of Living in Marrakech
* Marrakech & its Territories
* Whether towards the Atlantic coast or towards the mountains, you will be surprised by the diversity of the landscapes crossed, sometimes arid, sometimes luxuriant, and by the wealth of possibilities for activities.
* The well-being

* Hammams are public baths where Marrakchis and Moroccans in general come to wash their bodies, but also their minds, discussing and relieving themselves of their daily worries. These hammams are found in every district of Marrakech. You will inevitably see the entrance, during your wanderings. They are usually located near a mosque, offering purification to the body before prayer.

* Art of cooking

    * Marrakech has developed a rich and varied know-how and traditions in the field of culinary art. If the Tanjia has had the privilege of anticipating other local recipes, many dishes (Hergma, Medfouna, Khoubiza, Tajine ... ..) synthesize the influences that have converged on Marrakech from the whole of southern Morocco, and since then have been specialties from Marrakech.

* Courtesy and joke

    * Marrakchis have a reputation for being courteous, welcoming and cheerful, with a great sense of humor. However, this sense of joking accounts for certain tensions due to the possession of such a heritage. As for the warmth of the welcome, it is amplified by the preeminence of commerce and services as well as the growth of tourism.


* The Dekka Marrakechia

    * Marrakchis are known for their passion for music. Any Marrakchi worthy of the name must be able to lend himself to the exercise of “Kref El Mizan” whenever the opportunity arises, an exercise rooted in local traditions including the dakka. The latter is in particular part of the Ashura festivities, during which, the districts of the city engage themselves during entire nights, in a real competition.

* The Nzahats

    * Marrakchis who are used in summer, to seek in the surroundings, a little freshness, in the shade of wooded spaces or near the rivers, preserve until today, the tradition of organizing group outings, with friends or family, with particular enthusiasm for the Menara olive grove, the gardens of Agdal and the Ourika valley or that of Moulay Brahim.

* Travel on two wheels

    * The bicycle has acquired since the time of the protectorate, and recently the motorcycle, a big place in the movements within the Medina. Their anchoring in traditions has made this mode of transport present in almost all the old families of the city, a means of locomotion that has spread even for fairly long trips, as is the case between the city and its external margins. The bicycle is currently becoming a means of ballad in the surroundings of the Medina, for tourists.

* Crafts in Marrakech

    * Moroccan art can be classified into two categories: urban and rural

    * The first is imbued with traditions imported from the East or Andalusia. The oriental influence is particularly noticeable in carpets, fabrics, and embroidery, while the Andalusian imprint appears in the arts of ceramics, metal, wood and leather. The rural or Berber arts have a more bare aspect. Objects often have a utilitarian function: furniture, tools, utensils, essential for everyday life and some ornaments for community celebrations.

    * Wood: Woodworking is considered a refined art in Morocco, which requires a lot of thoroughness and patience. The presence of many species of trees in abundance especially in the valleys and mountains, such as cedar, pine, beech, olive, lemon, has been conducive to the development of this craft.

    * Pottery: In Morocco, this age-old tradition has risen to a rarely equaled artistic level. The three main poles of pottery and ceramics production in Morocco are represented in Fez, Safi and Salé. Pottery is obviously represented by the national dish which is the tajine. This word designates both the culinary preparation and the terracotta container that houses it. Its form varies according to the regions of the country. The tagines of the Ourika Valley are particularly famous.

    * The rugs: The art of the carpet has been enriched over time, with the creations of craftsmen from the different communities that have populated Morocco and from all the dynasties that have followed one another. It is a popular tradition, each region having its own characteristics, thickness, texture, colors and patterns of its rugs, rugs present in each Moroccan interior.

    * Tissues: Weaving made its appearance in Morocco from 1500 BC. JC Since then, served by a great diversity of materials, it is the flagship of Moroccan craftsmanship. The textiles of the tribes are among the most dazzling on the African continent. The rhythm of the patterns, the vibrations of the colors and the melody of the textures, give them a special power.

    * Metals: It is essentially silver, copper and their derivatives. They are first of all used in jewelry, women's jewelry, essential complements to party outfits and those intended for men, most often in silver. They are also used in ironwork, damascene (originating in Syria, it consists of embedding smooth silver and gold threads into the metal), brassware (pressed pieces), and nickel silver work (copper alloy, zinc and nickel, whose white luster is reminiscent of silver).

* Traditional clothes


    * Despite the many Western influences, each inhabitant has in his wardrobe traditional Moroccan clothes, all classes combined:

    * The Caftan: unique in the world, thanks to its oriental, Roman and Andalusian origin, but also thanks to the genius of Moroccan craftsmanship, it is worn by women. It is a sort of loose and long coat, made of velvet or brocade.

    * The Takchita: The takchita is composed of two superimposed caftans, below, the tahtiya and above, the fouqia or dfina which is open and often transparent. These two pieces are held at the waist by richly crafted belts called “Mdamma”.

    * The Djellaba: This long loose dress, often provided with a hood and long sleeves, made of wool, cotton or silk, is worn by both men and women. Among Moroccan women, djellabas are distinguished by the profusion of colors, patterns and embroidery.

    * The Chèche: Scarf about 4 to 8 meters long, it is worn in particular by the Tuaregs, and in North Africa in general. The men wrap it around their head and face, to protect themselves from the sun, the dry wind and the desert sand.

    * Gandoura: This long tunic of Berber origin has no sleeves and hood. It is traditionally worn in the Maghreb.

    * The Jabador: Of Roman origin, this fabric is wrapped around the body and held at the waist by a belt and fixed to the shoulders by fibulas.

    * The Haik: Large piece of wool or cotton about 5 by 1,6 meters, conceals both the body and the face of women.
